\section{Focus of Research and Interests}

As the large majority of the team is composed of Undergraduate students, these members are not actively in research. However, the team also provides a test bed for PhD students to use the platforms we build to perform research. The RoboNotts team is interested in assisting the following research areas:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Robotic Safety
  \item Object Detection 
  \item Human-Robot Interaction
\end{itemize}

Recent Publications by students within the team, or that have been assisted by the team include:
